# chat_messengerapp

A Flutter project.
Based on chat functionalities like logging in, signing up, modifying your name and status, posting, liking posts, and commenting on them, this app's core functions are similar to those of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

To store chats, posts, likes, and user details, I used Firebase.
It also has dark and light mode
